=Overview=
The AHBSPACEWIRE TLM model can be used to simulate behavior and timing of the GRLIB SPACEWIRE VHDL IP connected to the SoCRocket AHB Bus via AHB Slave Interface. 
Due to the lack ofspecification how to connect the SPACEWIRE TLM IP provided by the esa this component demonstrates how to connect it as AHB Slave. 
Therefore the model abstraction is only LT. The component basically adapts from proper TLM to the spacewire connection Socket. 
For more information see the Spacewire TLM Model Manuals.



=Data structure=

SpaceWire/ - from 27.12.10
