=This folder contains all data of the APBCTRL systemC model. Tests can be found in the folder 'tests'.=

=Overview=
The APBCTRL TLM model can be used to simulate behavior and timing of the GRLIB APBCTRL AHB-to-APB Bridge VHDL IP. The model is available at two levels of abstractions (LT and AT). For modeling the APBCTRL we mostly follow the recommendations given in RD06.
All details regarding APB protocol modeling at transaction level (payload structure, TLM phase mapping) can be found in the SoCRocket Interconnect Methodology [RD9].
