This folder contains the model for the ahbctrl.Tests can be found in the folder 'tests'

Overview
The AHBCTRL TLM model can be used to simulate behavior and timing of the GRLIB AHB Controller VHDL IP. The model is available at two levels of abstractions (LT and AT).
For modeling the AHBCTRL we mostly follow the recommendations given in RD06.
All details regarding AHB protocol modeling at transaction level (payload structure, TLM phase mapping) can be found in the SoCRocket Interconnect Methodology RD9.

./adapters 		- The RTL co-simulation adapters for the bus

ahbctrl.h/cpp		- The implementation of the AHBCTRL
ahbctrl_test.h/cpp	- All tests inherit from class ahbctrl_test.
ahbctrl_wrapper.h	- Declaration of class ahbctrl_wrapper (for co-sim of the RTL bus model)

./test1 - Testbench for minimum bus configuration containing 1 master and 1 slave
./test2 - Testbench for bus configuration with 2 masters and 2 slaves
./test3 - Configuration with 16 masters (max) and 1 slave
./test4 - Configuration with 1 master and 16 slaves (max)
./test5 - Confiugration with 16 masters (max) and 16 slaves (max)
 
typ_adapters.vhd 	- Co-sim can not handle VHDL integers with 'range' parameter.
			  Some datatyps have been overloaded here.
