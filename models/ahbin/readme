This folder contains all data for the ahbin model.

Overview
The AHBIN model generates input data for the AHB bus. The input data consists of fixed size random data frames, which are written to a certain address in a certain interval. 
The class inherits from the AHBMaster and CLKDevice classes. The model can be seen as a reference implementation of an AHB Master, since it is very simple. 
It has no VHDL reference in the Gaisler Library.
