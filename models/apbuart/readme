=This folder contains all data regarding the APBUART module.=

=Overview=
The APBUART model creates an UART device, which is mapped to a TCP port on the host system. The class inherits from the classes gs::reg::gr_device, APBDevice and CLKDevice. This model can be used as a serial console for exchanging data or printing debug information. The model has several registers which are listed in table 45. Further information can be found in RD04  (chapter 16.)
