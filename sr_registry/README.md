SoCRocket SystemC Model Registry {#sc_registry}
================================

To support switchable backends for UARTs, Displays or 
Memories it is very convenient to have a common registry
and factory in the simulation environment which can create
any registered sc_module.

SoCRocket is solving this task with this registry.
